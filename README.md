# ✈️ US Flight Delay Analysis

## Overview

This project analyses 2008 US flight data (2.3M+ rows) to uncover patterns in delays, cancellations, and travel trends. We used **Pig**, **Hive**, **Spark**, and **Python** to clean, process, and visualise the data, along with a basic machine learning experiment.

## Goals

- Identify delay trends by time, airline, and location  
- Analyse cancellation and disruption reasons  
- Predict flight status (early, on-time, delayed, cancelled) using ML models

## Tools Used

- Apache Pig & Hive (data cleaning and queries)  
- Spark (ML classification models)  
- Python & GeoPandas (data joins and maps)

## Highlights

- American Airlines had the worst delays; Aloha the best  
- Most delays occurred midweek; March was the worst month  
- Logistic Regression gave 64.8% accuracy in flight status prediction  
- California had the most delays; NJ had the highest delay rate
